        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mix bread crumbs, parsley, garlic, lemon zest, and black pepper in a large bowl; rub onto pork chops to coat completely.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry coated pork chops in hot oil until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side; transfer to a baking sheet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, flip, and continue baking until no longer pink in the center, about 25 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
