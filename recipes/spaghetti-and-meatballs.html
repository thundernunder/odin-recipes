        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Tender bison meatballs with tomato and mushroom sauce over whole grain spaghetti. The sauce is chunkier than regular tomato sauce and is great even without the meatballs. I love serving this with Pillsbury® garlic bread sticks.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    5 green onions, chopped
                </li>
                <li>
                    ¼ cup finely chopped fresh parsley
                </li>
                <li>
                    1½ pounds 7% ground bison meat
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 slice bread, torn into pieces
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Combine green onions, parsley, oregano, and basil in a bowl; mix well.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place bison in a bowl. Add 1/2 cup of the green onion mixture. Add egg, bread, 1 teaspoon salt, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix until evenly combined.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shape mixture into eight 1 1/2-inch-wide meatballs. Place in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add red wine; cover and cook for 8 minutes. Flip and continue cooking, covered, for 8 minutes longer. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Set aside and keep warm. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add remaining green onion mixture, onion, mushrooms, and 1 teaspoon salt. Saute until onions are translucent, about 10 minutes. Add spaghetti sauce and stewed tomatoes. Bring to a boil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Season sauce with salt and pepper and serve over spaghetti. Top with meatballs and garnish with Parmesan cheese.
                </li>
            </ol>
